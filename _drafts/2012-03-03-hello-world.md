title: hello world.

No matter how much I learn as a programmer, I learn primarily that
there's more to learn. It's a humbling clich√© I've recently
come to embrace.

Last Thanksgiving I submitted my first pull request on GitHub.
An epic moment, clearly disproportionate to its 10 lines of
code, finally proved to me that every fix, feature and test, no matter how
small, has value.

I'm currently working to streamline some of my company's processes
using Node and Git. As a part of this, I lead weekly team sessions
covering related topics. What I have come to realize through this is
that despite the abundance of write-ups and hello-worlds,
their value can sometimes be quantified as much by what is gained 
in their writing as their reading.
