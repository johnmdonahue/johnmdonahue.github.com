title: hello world.

No matter what I learn as a programmer, I learn mostly that there's more. It's a humbling clich√© I've come to embrace.

Last Thanksgiving I submitted my first pull request on GitHub. An epic moment &mdash; clearly disproportionate to its 10 lines &mdash; proved that every fix, feature and test, no matter how small, has value.

I'm currently working to streamline some of my company's processes using Node and Git. As a part of this, I lead weekly team sessions covering related topics. What I've realized is that despite the abundance of write-ups and hello-worlds, sometimes value can be quantified as much by what is gained in writing as reading.
